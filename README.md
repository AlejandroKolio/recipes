## Objective

Create a standalone java application which allows users to manage their favourite recipes. It should
allow adding, updating, removing and fetching recipes. Additionally users should be able to filter
available recipes based on one or more of the following criteria:
1. Whether or not the dish is vegetarian
2. The number of servings
3. Specific ingredients (either include or exclude)
4. Text search within the instructions.


For example, the API should be able to handle the following search requests:
1. All vegetarian recipes
2. Recipes that can serve 4 persons and have “potatoes” as an ingredient
3. Recipes without “salmon” as an ingredient that has “oven” in the instructions.

## Requirements
Please ensure that we have some documentation about the architectural choices and also how to
run the application. The project is expected to be delivered as a GitHub (or any other public git
hosting) repository URL.

All these requirements needs to be satisfied:

1. It must be a REST application implemented using Java (use a framework of your choice)
2. Your code should be production-ready.
3. REST API must be documented
4. Data must be persisted in a database
5. Unit tests must be present
6. Integration tests must be present
